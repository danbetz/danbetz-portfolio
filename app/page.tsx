      {/* Case Studies */}
      <section className="work-summary" id="work">
        <h2 className="font-header">VP Product & Design @ DonorsChoose</h2>
        <p>I lead the product, design, and UX research team at DonorsChoose. Our small but mighty team helps DonorsChoose deliver on its missionâ€”to make it easy for anyone to help a teacher in need, moving us closer to a nation where students in every community have the tools and experiences they need for a great education. We design the site experience to empower teachers to tell their stories in a compelling way and make it easy and gratifying for donors to find classroom projects to support. I also order the pizza for QA testing parties.</p>

        <h2 className="font-header">Senior Product Designer @ Etsy</h2>
        <p>While at Etsy, I worked on internationalizing the site, designed the first-generation apps for iPhone, iPad, and Android, helped build the mobile web interface, and worked to improve search. I also founded Sweatsy, the unofficial workout club and was the three-time first runner up for the Etsy&apos;s Fittest Man competition.</p>

        <h2 className="font-header">Design Director @ Seamless</h2>
        <p>During my time at Seamless, I led the design team and helped redesign every corner of the web interface including leading UX and visual design for the iPhone app, Android app, Blackberry app (!!!). I participated in several, but never won an office bake-off.</p>

        <h2 className="font-header">Web Designer @ W. W. Norton &amp; Co.</h2>
        <p>At Norton, I was responsible for designing and maintaining the online book catalog for all college books. I also begrudgingly did a little print and multimedia work, but my main focus was on the web. I&apos;m still riding the high of winning a hotly contested chocolate chip cookie bake-off in 2004.</p>

        <h2 className="font-header">Graphic Designer @ The Graphics Source</h2>
        <p>I learned a ton as a jack-of-all-trades designer at this small design shop. There was a lot of print work, some branding projects, but I also took the lead as the main &quot;web guy&quot; and worked on all website design projects that came our way. </p>

        <h2 className="font-header">Junior Designer @ Cleaner&apos;s Supply</h2>
        <p>While still a full-time college student, I got my feet wet designing garment bags, hangers, and all sorts of dry cleaner-related projects. I also had the opportunity to design the first version of cleanersupply.com, which enabled their online ordering platform and remains virtually unchanged many years later!</p>
